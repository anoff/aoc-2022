This will be the best advented code ever!
Trying to use test driven development and typed python.

Code auto-formatted with black

## Things I learned

### Python

- `set()`s are awesome to get unique elements from a list
- `set()`s also allow you to find intersections and overlaps

### Programming approach

- TDD on top level is always worth it
- adding tests for smaller steps creates very modular code..maybe too many functions, seem to lack cohesion because all functions are only used one time
